Create a Psuedocode Algoritym to perform the following function:
    Convert Decimal Numbers (like 255) to its equivalent binary number format (11111111)

    write down the decimal number
    divide the number by 2
    write the answer below
    Store the remainder as a value
    this value will be highest value bit
    divide the answer to the previous division by 2
    write the answer below
    store the remainder with the highest value bit
    repeat this process until the answer to the division is 0
    your binary number format will be read from the highest value to lowest value
